What I'm learning from building my portfolio website:

The dependencies that are required when building application from scratch.

Tier 1:

- basic format with tabs and links to profile pages

Tier 2:

- deployed to Heroku

Tier 3:

-fancy CSS and FLEXBOX formatting

Takeaways:
-index.html is a static file and should be in the public folder
-added css file, but not sure if it's being loaded into bundle.js
